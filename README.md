# SwarmboTron

SwarmboTron is a low budget swarm implementation of real and simulated robots.  
The swarm is able to work together to achieve a certain goal. The power of this application lies in the collaboration between simulated and real robots. The real robots take into account the simulated robots and vice versa.

This project was started at the university of applied sciences. The goal was simple and that was that we had to create a swarm. And so we did. It is created by 4 students in only 7 weeks. We worked 4 days in the week for this application. And this is the result.

Getting Started
======
There 2 ways you can use this project.

The first way is to only use the application and not use it in a developer environment.
You can download the repository and run the SwarmboTron.exe located in the Windows release folder. You will not need any real robots if you like. If you want to make real robots you can follow the [Assemble robot](https://github.com/RemcoMusic/Server-application/wiki/Assemble) guide.

The second way is with the developer environment. You will need to start at step 1 and follow the whole guide.  
The guide can be found over at the [wiki](https://github.com/RemcoMusic/Server-application/wiki)
